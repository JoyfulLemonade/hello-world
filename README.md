I'm afraid and tired. This day just doesn't seem to end from my tarantula dying to having to sit in an IHOP praying to god that the wifi holds up.
This day is tiring, swealtering, and proof that when I get a job that pays more than 11,000 dollars a year; I'm purchasing a dozen routers and paying top dollar for wifi in my residence. The nightmare never ends, everything I touch is sticky with IHOP pecan praline syrup from my mouse to my keyboard, even mysoul is tainted with the accursed fluid.
